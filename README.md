This script uses the scapy library to send a SYN packet to the target host and checks the response for common vulnerabilities like Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160) or CVE-2019-9511.

To use this script, save it to a file named scan_vulnerabilities_scapy.py and run it from the command line with the target IP address as an argument:


Copy code
*python scan_vulnerabilities_scapy.py 192.168.1.1*
Keep in mind that this script is a simplified example and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities. It's important to note that scanning for vulnerabilities is a complex task that requires careful analysis of network traffic and system responses.

Please note that you need to have the scapy library installed on your system to run this script. You can install it using *pip install scapy*.
