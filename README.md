Save the script to a file named scan_vulnerabilities.py in your repository.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

Download

pip install nmap

Run the script with the target IP address or range of IP addresses as an argument:

python scan_vulnerabilities.py 192.168.1.1-254

Replace 192.168.1.1-254 with the actual target IP address or range of IP addresses you want to scan.

Observe the output to see if any vulnerabilities have been found.

If vulnerabilities are found, you can take appropriate actions to mitigate or remediate them.

Remember to use caution when scanning networks or hosts for vulnerabilities, as it may be considered malicious activity by some security systems.

Please note that the script provided is a simplified example and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities. It's important to thoroughly test and validate any security-related scripts before running them on your systems.
